condition_id
# I anticipate this will mainly be used to suppress very_hot and very_cold. Simply remove the hash symbol from those lines to suppress them.
# Be careful when adding certain conditions like water_surface - suppression removes all effects of the condition,
# which can result in bugs if you suppress one that's necessary for markets to function properly.
# Note that if you remove conditions from this list in the middle of save, those conditions will not be unsuppressed.
# If you want to remove conditions from this list in the middle of a save, deconstruct the building(s) first, then remove the conditions.
