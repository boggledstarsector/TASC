First up is the context object `RequirementContext` that is passed into a lot of things. Aside from the `contextName`, everything may be null. In general, grab what you need from the context and then check them all for null. Handle those cases appropriately.

## Terraforming projects
The `id` field is a file unique identifier. Other mods can override a project entirely by providing their own `terraforming_projects.csv` with an entry with the same `id` field. This is not the recommended way of modifying a project. Check `terraforming_project_mods.csv` and the `Terraforming Projects Mods` section.

`enable_settings` is a `|` separated list of mod specific setting IDs (`LunaLib`'s `LunaSettings.csv` or vanilla's `settings.json`). If the setting is `false`, then this project will not be available.

`project_type` is where the project should be displayed. `terraforming` projects are shown at the top of the terraforming UI, with `crafting` projects underneath them. `ability` and `industry` projects are used for abilities and industries respectively, and so aren't shown in the terraforming UI.

`tooltip` is the tooltip shown for the project. It's displayed on buttons in the terraforming UI and on the intel message when the project finishes.

`intel_complete_message` is the message shown when the project completes successfully.

It's a JSON Array of JSON Objects with two fields, `requirement_id` is the ID of the requirement from `terraforming_requirements_OR.csv`, `and_then` is a JSON Array of JSON Objects of requirements to be checked only if this requirement is satisfied. This means you can have requirements that are only checked if previous requirements are met. One example is only checking the nearest planet's owner if the fleet is not in hyperspace.

`requirements_hidden` is the requirements for the project to be visible. Same format as `requirements`.

`base_project_duration` is the project's duration in days.

## Industry options
The `id` field is a file unique identifier. Other mods can override an industry entirely by providing their own `industry_options.csv.csv` with an entry with the same `id` field.

`industry_id` and `project_id` are the `id` fields from `industry_options.csv` and `terraforming_projects.csv` that this modification will be applied to.

The rest of the fields are additions and removals from the corresponding field without `_added` and `_removed` from `industry_options.csv` and `terraforming_projects.csv`. Entries are added before being removed.

`requirements_added` is the same format as `requirements` in `terraforming_projects.csv` with an additional optional `parent_id` field in each entry. If `parent_id` is specified, the requirements will be added to the `and_then` collection of the specified ID.

The industry must implement the `BoggledIndustryInterface`. If the industry plugin is specified as `boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry`, `boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Remnant_Station`, or `boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Cryosanctum` then it does. Other mod specified industry plugins may work.

# Adding New Types
Create a new class that extends `BoggledTerraformingRequirement.TerraformingRequirement`, implement all required functions. Create a new class that implements `BoggledTerraformingRequirementFactory.TerraformingRequirementFactory` and implement `constructFromJSON`. Call `boggledTools.addTerraformingRequirementFactory` with what you want the requirement type to be called, and an instance of the new requirement factory.

Do the same thing for `BoggledTerraformingProjectEffect.TerraformingProjectEffect`, `BoggledTerraformingProjectEffectFactory.TerraformingProjectEffectFactory`, and `boggledTools.addTerraformingProjectEffectFactory`
