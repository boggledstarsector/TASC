BOGGLED_MESOZOIC_PARK,Mesozoic Park,45,90,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/mesozoic_park_terran.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Mesozoic_Park,"Humans have long been fascinated by extinct Old Earth megafauna. Although no DNA from these creatures has survived to the present day, new organisms that resemble them can be created using genetic engineering. Wealthy tourists and trophy hunters are drawn to worlds where these ""terrible lizards"" roam the wilds, provided the colony is easily accessible and stable enough for visitors to feel safe. Living on a planet teeming with gigantic carnivorous lizards is hazardous, and once introduced, the dinosaurs will be almost impossible to eradicate.",
BOGGLED_LIMELIGHT_NETWORK,Limelight Network,90,180,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_limelight.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Limelight_Network,"A shared virtual reality environment accessed through cybernetic implants. Banned by the Domain and most post-Collapse polities due to its highly addictive nature - many users ignore the real world until they deplete their financial resources and are forced to exit the simulation. Fikenhild's government grudgingly tolerates the Limelight Network because the fantasies of users serve as excellent inspiration for the holo-entertainment industry. The supercomputer running the simulation is of Domain origin and requires Domain-era artifacts for maintenance.",
BOGGLED_GPA,Galatian Particle Accelerator,180,360,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_gpa.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_GPA,"The GPA, or Galatian Particle Accelerator, is used by the Galatian Academy to conduct particle physics research.

BOGGLED_DOMED_CITIES,Domed Cities,60,90,,3,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_domed_cities.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Domed_Cities,"Hermetically sealed domes dozens of kilometers across can enclose the bulk of a colony's population in a relatively Earth-like environment. Hazardous conditions imposed by atmospheric properties, extreme weather and dangerous fauna are mitigated inside the domes. Concentrating industrial and population centers under fragile domes makes the colony almost defenseless against raiding and bombardment, and is unacceptably risky on worlds with extreme tectonic activity or frequent meteor impacts.",
BOGGLED_DOMAIN_ARCHAEOLOGY,Domain Archaeology,30,45,,2,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/domain_archaeology.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Domain_Archaeology,"The Collapse plunged the Sector into a dark age.
