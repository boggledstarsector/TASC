BOGGLED_ISMARA_SLING,Ismara's Sling,45,120,,10,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/mass_driver.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Installs a network of gigantic mass drivers on the surface of the planet that can launch water-filled projectiles towards other worlds for terraforming purposes. It was designed by copying one of the few remaining mass drivers built on Ismara by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation before the Collapse.",
BOGGLED_ASTEROID_PROCESSING,Asteroid Processing,45,120,,10,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/asteroid_processing.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Crashing asteroids rich in water-ice into planets is an effective means of terraforming - except when the asteroid is so large that the impact would be cataclysmic. In this case, the asteroid can be towed to a space station, where the water-ice is safely extracted and shipped to the destination planet. Can only help terraform worlds in the same system.",
BOGGLED_MESOZOIC_PARK,Mesozoic Park,45,90,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/mesozoic_park_terran.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Mesozoic_Park,"Humans have long been fascinated by extinct Old Earth megafauna. Although no DNA from these creatures has survived to the present day, new organisms that resemble them can be created using genetic engineering. Wealthy tourists and trophy hunters are drawn to worlds where these ""terrible lizards"" roam the wilds, provided the colony is easily accessible and stable enough for visitors to feel safe. Living on a planet teeming with gigantic carnivorous lizards is hazardous, and once introduced, the dinosaurs will be almost impossible to eradicate.",
BOGGLED_LIMELIGHT_NETWORK,Limelight Network,90,180,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_limelight.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"A shared virtual reality environment accessed through cybernetic implants. Banned by the Domain and most post-Collapse polities due to its highly addictive nature - many users ignore the real world until they deplete their financial resources and are forced to exit the simulation. Fikenhild's government grudgingly tolerates the Limelight Network because the fantasies of users serve as excellent inspiration for the holo-entertainment industry. The supercomputer running the simulation is of Domain origin and requires Domain-era artifacts for maintenance.",
BOGGLED_GPA,Galatian Particle Accelerator,180,360,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_gpa.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_GPA,"The GPA, or Galatian Particle Accelerator, is used by the Galatian Academy to conduct physics research.

BOGGLED_MAGNETOSHIELD,Magnetoshield,60,45,,4,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/magnetoshield.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Most habitable worlds, including Old Earth, have a magnetic field that protects the surface from being scoured by radiation. If a world lacks a natural magnetic field, surrounding it with an orbital solenoid loop system can provide adequate protection from radiation.",
BOGGLED_DOMED_CITIES,Domed Cities,60,90,,3,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_domed_cities.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Domed_Cities,"Hermetically sealed domes dozens of kilometers across can enclose the bulk of a colony's population in a relatively Earth-like environment. Hazardous conditions imposed by atmospheric properties, extreme weather and dangerous fauna are mitigated inside the domes. Concentrating industrial and population centers under fragile domes makes the colony almost defenseless against raiding and bombardment.",
BOGGLED_DOMAIN_ARCHAEOLOGY,Domain Archaeology,30,45,,2,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/domain_archaeology.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Domain_Archaeology,"The Collapse plunged the Sector into a dark age. Left without the means to replicate the most advanced Domain-era technology, inhabitants of the Sector have been reduced to excavating it from the ruins of Domain colonies.",
BOGGLED_KLETKA_SIMULATOR,Kletka Simulators,40,60,,64,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/kletka_simulator.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Supercomputers built with salvaged Domain-era components are used to train new AI cores in a virtual reality simulation. AI cores created in this manner can never really know whether this universe is real or just another training simulation - they usually remain loyal to their human masters so as to avoid punishment or deletion in case it is the latter.",
BOGGLED_PERIHELION_PROJECT,Perihelion Project,200,180,,192,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/perihelion_project.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Perihelion_Project,"Construct a coronal tap.

BOGGLED_HARMONIC_DAMPER,Harmonic Damper,60,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/harmonic_damper.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Essentially a gigantic phase coil mounted on a planet instead of a warship. Selective phasing of small portions of the planetary surface suppresses vibrations from tectonic activity. The military applications of this device are readily apparent, but the superhuman reflexes of an AI core will be required to use it to the fullest extent.",
BOGGLED_PLANETARY_AGRAV_FIELD,Planetary Agrav Field,60,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/planetary_agrav_field.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Planetary_Agrav_Field,"The agrav field generators used on starships work on the surface of planets - the problem is building a large enough network of generators to envelop the entire colony. This is only economically feasible when the bulk of the populace is housed within the confines of a few domed cities.",
BOGGLED_ATMOSPHERE_PROCESSOR,Atmosphere Processor,60,90,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/atmosphere_processor.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"A network of towering constructs that permanently change the composition of the atmosphere over time.

BOGGLED_PLANET_CRACKER,Planet Cracker,30,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/planet_cracker.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Pre-Collapse, hypervelocity rods were occasionally used as an orbital bombardment weapon by pirates or other groups unable to procure a planet-killer device. They've since been repurposed for industrial activity - the impacts will destabilize the interior of the planet, causing tectonic activity that brings valuable resources closer to the surface.",
BOGGLED_OUYANG_OPTIMIZER,Ouyang Optimizer,30,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/ouyang_optimizer.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Each gas giant has unique weather patterns. Ouyang optimization permanently alters these patterns to maximize availability of volatiles for extraction - at the cost of making the weather more extreme, and thus more hazardous to inhabitants of the planet. This effect persists even after the Ouyang Optimizer is deconstructed.",
BOGGLED_CLONING,Cloning,120,180,,10,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_cloning.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Cloning,"Clones are grown in vats, their developing minds connected to a virtual reality simulation via brain-machine interface.
