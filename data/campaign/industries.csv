It was designed by copying one of the few remaining mass drivers built on Ismara by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation before the Collapse.",
BOGGLED_ASTEROID_PROCESSING,Asteroid Processing,45,120,,10,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/asteroid_processing.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Crashing asteroids rich in water-ice into planets is an effective means of terraforming - except when the asteroid is so large that the impact would be cataclysmic. In this case, the asteroid can be towed to a space station, where the water-ice is safely extracted and shipped to the destination planet. Can only help terraform worlds in the same system.",
BOGGLED_MESOZOIC_PARK,Mesozoic Park,45,90,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/mesozoic_park_terran.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Humans have long been fascinated by extinct Old Earth megafauna. Although no DNA from these creatures has survived to the present day, new organisms that resemble them can be created using genetic engineering. Wealthy tourists and trophy hunters are drawn to worlds where these ""terrible lizards"" roam the wilds, provided the colony is easily accessible and stable enough for visitors to feel safe. Living on a planet teeming with gigantic carnivorous lizards is hazardous, and once introduced, the dinosaurs will be almost impossible to eradicate.",
BOGGLED_LIMELIGHT_NETWORK,Limelight Network,90,180,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_limelight.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"A shared virtual reality environment accessed through cybernetic implants. Banned by the Domain and most post-Collapse polities due to its highly addictive nature - many users ignore the real world until they deplete their financial resources and are forced to exit the simulation. Fikenhild's government grudgingly tolerates the Limelight Network because the fantasies of users serve as excellent inspiration for the holo-entertainment industry. The supercomputer running the simulation is of Domain origin and requires Domain-era artifacts for maintenance.",
BOGGLED_GPA,Galatian Particle Accelerator,180,360,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_gpa.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"The GPA, or Galatian Particle Accelerator, is used by the Galatian Academy to conduct particle physics research.

BOGGLED_MAGNETOSHIELD,Magnetoshield,60,45,,4,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/magnetoshield.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Most habitable worlds, including Old Earth, have a magnetic field that protects the surface from being scoured by radiation. If a world lacks a natural magnetic field, surrounding it with an orbital solenoid loop system can provide adequate protection from radiation.",
BOGGLED_DOMED_CITIES,Domed Cities,60,90,,3,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_domed_cities.jpg,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"Hermetically sealed domes dozens of kilometers across can enclose the bulk of a colony's population in a relatively Earth-like environment. Hazardous conditions imposed by atmospheric properties, extreme weather and dangerous fauna are mitigated inside the domes. Concentrating industrial and population centers under fragile domes makes the colony almost defenseless against raiding and bombardment, and is unacceptably risky on worlds with extreme tectonic activity or frequent meteor impacts.",
BOGGLED_SEAFLOOR_CITIES,Seafloor Cities,60,90,,3,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_seafloor_cities.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"It's not impossible to build a city at the bottom of the sea - in fact, it's advantageous when defending against raids and bombardment. Most space marines lack experience operating in an underwater environment, and kinetic weapons are ineffective against submerged targets. However, traders are hampered by the underwater conditions, which makes the colony less accessible.",
BOGGLED_DOMAIN_ARCHAEOLOGY,Domain Archaeology,30,45,,2,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/domain_archaeology.png,boggled.campaign.econ.industries.BoggledBaseIndustry,"The Collapse plunged the Sector into a dark age.
