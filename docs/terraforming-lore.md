## Terraforming Organizations and Corporations {#terraform-organizations}

### Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation

The most prominent terraforming organization in the Domain, mentioned repeatedly throughout the game:

- **Industry**: Produced specialized terraforming equipment including **Autonomous Mantle Bore** and **Soil Nanites** (special_items.csv:18,20)
- **Stellar Mirrors/Shades**: "The art of their use was brought to apogee by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming corporation during the golden age of the Domain's expansion phase" (descriptions.csv:968,969)
- **Terran Standards**: "The Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation specs provide the most widely accepted 'terran' baseline for the allegedly ideal human environment" (descriptions.csv:1364)
- **Industrial Base**: Kazeron's industrial base was "built to feed the Domain's Persean frontier heavy machinery and terraforming plant" (descriptions.csv:1430)

---

## Terraforming Projects and Worlds {#terraforming-projects}

### Asharu Terraforming Project

- **Abandoned Station**: "An abandoned orbital staging area for the Asharu terraforming project. Castoff bulk-carrier segments welded between a honeycomb of emptied fuel tanks once formed concourses teeming with engineers and colonists" (descriptions.csv:898)

### Chicomoztoc

- **Industrial Terraforming**: "Only a marginal terraforming candidate upon discovery, rapid early industry and later war has left the atmosphere choked with complex sulphur compounds, organics refining by-products, and a concerning but manageable dusting of actinides" (descriptions.csv:917)

### Eventide

- **Tidally-Locked Terraforming**: "Eventide is a nearly tidally-locked world that was found to otherwise be an ideal candidate for terraforming. Just one day passes on Eventide per year, or near enough, leading to extreme winter-night and summer-day with mild twilight periods between. Judicious employment of stellar mirrors and shades allows ideal conditions to prevail in large pockets of carefully maintained territory" (descriptions.csv:918)
- **Climate Control**: "Islands of 'civilized' mild biomes are maintained through judicious use of solar shades and mirrors" (market_conditions.csv:31)

### Eochu Bres

- **Recent Terraforming**: "Terraformed late in the colonization of the Persean Sector, Eochu Bres is a world of peaks and fjords freshly torn by violent, rapidly changing weather. It is still colder than Terran-optimal in spite of an orbital mirror array completed shortly before the Collapse" (descriptions.csv:933)

### Ithaca and Ogygia

- **Terraforming Corporation Project**: "An old, dry world with little magnetic field to speak of, Ithaca was nonetheless judged a good candidate by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation. Quiet for billions of years, Penelope's Star became a hive of activity to fuel the transformation of Ithaca and its sibling world Ogygia, only to be thrown into complete chaos by the Collapse" (descriptions.csv:944)
- **Secondary Candidate**: "A smallish, barren world whose surface bears the mark of a truly catastrophic and relatively recent impact event, Ogygia was nonetheless considered a worthwhile secondary terraforming candidate due to the system-wide infrastructure being assembled for its sibling-world of Ithaca" (descriptions.csv:945)

### Qaras

- **Post-Collapse Terraforming**: "A habitable if cold world terraformed post-Collapse by stranded elements of the Eridani-Utopia Corporation using in-place infrastructure and stockpiles" (descriptions.csv:925)

### Barad

- **Volatiles Extraction for Terraforming**: "The thick, icy crust of this world is fed by cryovolcanoes that dot the surface. These frozen wastes are scored by mass-driver gantries from a time when the volatile elements of this world were extracted on a massive scale to feed terraforming efforts elsewhere in-system" (descriptions.csv:900)
- **Pirate Base**: "Originally built by Eridani-Utopia to coordinate volatiles extraction for massive terraforming projects, the station was abandoned post-collapse" (descriptions.csv:901)

### Gilead

- **Sporeship and Climate Machines**: "The face of Gilead is filled with green continents, seeded with Earth-life by sporeship and climate-stabilized by Eridani Utopia's vast terraforming machines. Then Ludd came and the Faithful turned the world into a garden-wilderness of astounding richness" (rules.csv:4323)

### Mazalot

- **Failed Terraforming Experiment**: Referred to as "this Luddie-infested backwater of a failed terraforming experiment" (rules.csv:7710)

### Mairaath

- **Biotechnology Wonder**: "Mairaath was a wonder of the Persean Sector. Three great cities in orbit, the Astropoli, and below a wonder of terraforming biotechnology" (rules.csv:38688)
- **Historian Reference**: "Old Mairaath, the center of the old Mayasuran stellar polity, was primed to blossom as a shining beacon of culture and civilization in the Persean Sector, a light to outshine Opis perhaps, once the terraforming came into true fruition" (rules.csv:38814)

---

## Terraforming Technology and Equipment {#terraforming-tech}

### Stellar Mirrors and Shades

- **Description**: "An ultra-light orbital mirror array used to reflect and concentrate solar energy. Stellar mirrors are a common terraforming tool and the art of their use was brought to apogee by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming corporation during the golden age of the Domain's expansion phase" (descriptions.csv:968)
- **Stellar Shades**: "An ultra-light orbital shade array used to deflect and collect solar energy. Stellar shades are a common terraforming tool and the art of their use was brought to apogee by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming corporation during the golden age of the Domain's expansion phase" (descriptions.csv:969)
- **Game Mechanic**: Solar Array market condition - "This planet has an array of solar shades or mirrors in orbit, judiciously positioned to bring its surface conditions closer to terran norms" (market_conditions.csv:169)

### Autonomous Mantle Bore

- **Manufacturer**: Eridani-Utopia Terraforming
- **Description**: "While it is believed there are no functional control override units remaining in the Sector, the bore itself is capable of independent - if sometimes unpredictable - operation. Automatic-mode failsafes preclude its use on habitable worlds" (special_items.csv:18)

### Soil Nanites

- **Manufacturer**: Eridani-Utopia Terraforming
- **Description**: "Enables soil enrichment and recovery at a rate far beyond that at which unaided natural processes perform. Domain Nanite Safety Regulation 4324, subsection 81 prohibits use on worlds with transplutonic ore or volatiles deposits, and unfortunately the built-in failsafe appears to be functional" (special_items.csv:20)

### Mass-Driver Terraforming Infrastructure

- **Ismara**: "A cold ice-ball of a world, Ismara was the perfect location to install mines and mass-driver facilities to launch mega-tonne slabs of graphene-encased water and nitrogen packages toward the inner system to nurture the terrestrial worlds of Penelope's Star" (descriptions.csv:948)

---

## Domain Megastructures {#domain-megastructures}

### Coronal Hypershunts

- **Description**: "This class of megastructure once powered the unfathomable industrial might of the Domain, putting the human civilization well toward Kardashev type II status. It is capable of extracting energy on an astronomical scale directly from the linked star. Losing control of an active coronal hypershunt without following proper shut-down procedures can prove disastrous" (descriptions.csv:1035)
- **Gallery Entry**: "These megastructures once powered the unfathomable industrial might of the Domain, putting the human civilization well toward Kardashev type II status" (descriptions.csv:1488,1489)
- **Self-Repair**: "as with most mega-scale Domain technology from the late pre-Collapse era, the hypershunt features fantastic self-repair capabilities which requires only sufficient resources to be made available" (rules.csv:14238)

### Gate Network

- **Gate Haulers**: "These were the massive, automated starships which bore the Gates that established near-instantaneous connections between distant stars. After a journey of countless lonely cycles, the Gate would be emplaced in a new system and activated, thence to disgorge an explosion of newcomers" (descriptions.csv:1447)
- **Purpose**: "to establish near-instantaneous connections between distant stars" (descriptions.csv:1447)
- **Hauler Discovery**: "A Leviathan from out of time, familiar at once from its depictions in the post-Domain Persean Sector. The magisterial force hushes and humbles officers and crew. It makes them reverent, as if they found themselves before the corpse of a thunderous, cruel god who once ruled the skies" (descriptions.csv:1444)

### Nanoforges

- **Corrupted Nanoforge**: "A powerful and versatile manufacturing 'black box', capable of building itself out to an industrial scale, given the necessary raw materials and human assistance. This one has seen better days, and is incapable of reliably producing defect-free components" (special_items.csv:5-7)
- **Pristine Nanoforge**: "A powerful and versatile manufacturing 'black box', capable of building itself out to an industrial scale, given the necessary raw materials and human assistance. This one is good as new, at least according to its on-board diagnostics" (special_items.csv:8-10)
- **Industrial Megafacility**: "Heavy industrial manufacturing relied on great nanoforges recovered from the ruins of the Domain. However their output quality decayed over cycles; nanoscale corruption led to growing macroscopic flaws" (descriptions.csv:1363)

## Life-Seeding and Colonization {#life-seeding}

### Derelict Seedships

- **Description**: "Seeds promising worlds with a suite of lifeforms to kick-start the processes which maintain a Terran environment, from hardy lichens to simple algae up through cryopod drops which release more advanced lifeforms as planetary conditions improve. The seedship will leave the world to gather new materials from small asteroids, manufacture a new terraforming starter kit, and move on to the next target" (descriptions.csv:1033)

### Sporeships

- **Desert Moon Ruins**: "An ancient sporeship encountered Cibola in a cooler and wetter age than its equilibrium, placing it within the ship's colonization parameters. Later Domain explorers found a dying world populated by a small, backward, and desperate civilization clinging to survival" (descriptions.csv:1352)
- **Coatl Station**: "Built around the core of a seedship from the first great migration wave to the Sector, Coatl Bastion has changed roles and names more times than any outsider cares to review" (descriptions.csv:920)
- **Telepylus Station**: "A vast orbital station built around the core of an old Expansion-era Sporeship buried under a forest of modular hangars, industrial pods, and hab rings" (descriptions.csv:946)

### Cryosleepers

- **Description**: "This is one of the massive vessels of legend which transported millions of human emigrants from the core systems of the Domain out into the great frontiers stretching from the Sagittarius Arm across the Orion Spur. Judging by the weak but stable EM read on the sensors, many of the sleeper caskets remain viable even after so many hundreds of cycles here on the wild shores of Perseus" (descriptions.csv:1034)
- **Gallery Entry**: "Those who awake from cryosleep who were laid to rest in the time of the Domain are perhaps the most lost of all. Many, though not all, imagined they would populate the far end of a rich frontier; they accepted that they would leave behind all they once knew. Now they all find themselves cut loose from all reference, unmoored in history" - the Historian (descriptions.csv:1490)
- **Revival Facilities**: "The necessary facilities for the mass revival and assimilation of the passengers of a Domain-era cryosleeper. Greatly increases population growth" (industries.csv:94)
- **Colonization Infrastructure**: "The colonization program dictated construction around key gravity wells of orbital infrastructure which included repair docks, industrial nanoforges, comms hubs, terraforming depots, armories, research laboratories, and habitation for defrosted cryosleepers" (descriptions.csv:1355)

## Atmospheric and Climate Manipulation {#atmospheric-manipulation}

### Terraformed World Conditions

- **Twilight World**: "Tidally locked to its primary, or near enough, [the world] is a terraformed world with days the length of seasons. Day/night temperature variation is accordingly harsh even to engineered terran life. Islands of 'civilized' mild biomes are maintained through judicious use of solar shades and mirrors" (market_conditions.csv:31)

- **Tundra World**: "Terraforming has brought terran life to [the world] but the world remains as cold as the deepest of Earth's ice ages. Though millions of square kilometers are covered in glacier, there are also taiga provinces and rolling steppe where warmer conditions prevail" (market_conditions.csv:32)

- **Barren-Marginal World**: "Inhospitable and unforgiving, outside conditions on [the world] are barely survivable to a human with an air mask and protective equipment, though certain engineered terraforming lichens find it tolerable enough" (market_conditions.csv:30)

### Climate Control Examples

- **Arroyo**: "A new range of mountains rises on the horizon, torn in half by catastrophic workings of the terraformers, and beyond is a chaos of steep valleys populated by dwarf pine and thin white waterfalls" (rules.csv:15085)

- **Ludd's Shrine**: "Pilgrims walk where Ludd walked, though the world is much changed from Ludd's day. A deep forest, carefully gardened over more than a hundred cycles, has replaced the towering industrial terraforming machines that once surrounded the shrine complex" (descriptions.csv:1273)

## Related Domain Technologies {#domain-tech}

### Orbital Fusion Lamp

- **Description**: "A miniaturized, variable-output fusion reactor capable of providing ample light and heat to a planet. Safe operation requires prodigious quantities of volatiles. If the demand is not met, the reactor suffers from potentially hazardous instability, which may lead to an uncontrolled surge in output" (special_items.csv:12)
- **Litigation**: "Litigation over whether this device is of inherently unsafe design or simply used unsafely were ongoing in Domain courts at the time of the Collapse" (special_items.csv:12)

### Synchrotron Core

- **Description**: "A specialized nanoforge, loaded with firmware and seed nano-tech to build itself out into a Synchrotron that allows industrial-scale antimatter production" (special_items.csv:11)

### Domain Research and Education

- **Galatia Academy**: "The Academy was founded pre-collapse, a humble institution of research and higher education on the grand frontier of the Domain. The dual foci were practical matters in fields from applied terraforming to engineering sciences and more theoretical pursuits, including study of local astrophysics and xenobiology" (rules.csv:14686)

### Domain Military Technology

- **Terraforming Weaponry**: Reference to weapons "widely employed in terraforming applications" (descriptions.csv:327)

- **Fuel Production**: "This facility produces starship fuel, the life-blood of interstellar civilization. Lacking Domain-tech components, fuel production is a laborious and slow process" (industries.csv:15)
- **Advanced Fuel Production**: "A massive Domain-tech facility produces starship fuel" (industries.csv:16)

### Cryoarithmetic Engine

- **Description**: "A quantum computer that violates the second law of thermodynamics by getting colder instead of hotter while performing computations. A massive, planet-wide network of tendrils - ending in heatsinks - extrudes itself, using heat to fuel growth and continued computation. The hotter the planet surface, the more effective the computation engine" (special_items.csv:24)

## Summary of Terraforming Capabilities

Based on the base game lore, the Domain of Man possessed the following terraforming and planetary engineering capabilities:

1. **Stellar Manipulation**: Orbital mirrors and shades to modify solar energy distribution
2. **Atmospheric Engineering**: Ability to create and modify planetary atmospheres
3. **Life-Seeding**: Sporeships and seedships to introduce Terran lifeforms
4. **Climate Stabilization**: Vast machines capable of maintaining stable climates on terraformed worlds
5. **Soil Enrichment**: Nanite-based soil modification technology
6. **Planetary Mining**: Mantle bores and mass-driver systems for resource extraction
7. **Orbital Infrastructure**: Fusion lamps to provide light and heat to planets
8. **Bio-Terraforming**: Biotechnology solutions for planetary transformation (as seen on Mairaath)

The Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation appears to have been the primary organization responsible for developing and deploying these technologies during the Domain's "golden age of expansion."
